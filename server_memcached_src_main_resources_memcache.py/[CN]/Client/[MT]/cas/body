    'Sets a key to a given value in the memcache if it hasn\'t been\n        altered since last fetched.

See the memcached protocol docs section\n        "Storage Commands" for more info on <exptime>.

If\n        the value being cached is a string, then the length of the string is\n        measured, else if the value is an object, then the length of the\n        pickle result is measured. If the resulting attempt at compression\n        yeilds a larger string than the input, then it is discarded. For\n        backwards compatability, this parameter defaults to 0, indicating\n        don\'t ever try to compress.\n        '
